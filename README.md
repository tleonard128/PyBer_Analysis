# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
Using Python's pandas library with matplotlib, I analyzed ride-share data for PyBer in order to analyze fares and drivers based on the type of city. I created different DataFrames and visualizations in order to present the analysis in a more easily digestable format.
## Results
### Summary of ride share data by city type

Based on the summary of ride-share data by city type, we can see a some key differences of ride data for different types of cities:
- Rural cities have much less rides and less drivers. These rides have a higher average fare and higher average fares per driver than both suburban and urban cities.
- Suburban cities have more rides and drivers than rural cities, but still not as many as urban cities. This puts them right in the middle in all catogeries including the total fare amount, average fare price per ride and average fare per driver.
- Urban cities have the most rides and the most drivers. They exceed both rural and suburban in the total fares. They do have less expensive average fares per ride and much lower average fare per driver. 

### Total Fair by City type from January 1 through April 28 of 2019

In the image above, we can see clearly that each week there are more in total fares for urban cities, reaching a high point of about $2,500 in a week, subarban cities bring in a total of between $700 and $1500 per week, and that rural cities did not exceed $500 in any week of the 4 months, hitting a low point of just over $50 in a week in February.

## Summary
Based on the data collected, the CEO of PyBer could do the following things for each city type. First, they could decrease the fare price for rural cities and increase the number of drivers to incentivize more people in rural cities to take ride shares while also offering more availability. Second, for suburban cities, they could also slightly increase the number of drivers in order to even out the distribution and pring down the fare price. Lastly, for urban cities, they could decrease the total number of drivers, creating less supply in order to increase the fare price and pay drivers more.
